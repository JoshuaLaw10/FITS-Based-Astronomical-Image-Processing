# Multi-Band-Star-Detection-and-Photometry-in-Astronomical-Images-Python-
Developed a Python-based pipeline using Astropy and Photutils to process FITS images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Implemented star detection using DAOStarFinder and performed aperture photometry across multiple spectral bands (u, g, r, i, z) for visualization and analysis of celestial objects.
